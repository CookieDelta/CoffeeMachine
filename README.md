# CoffeeMachine
Day 15 of 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu @ Udemy

First project uploaded to GitHub, and I hope one of many.
The coffee machine as it mentions on the instructions PDF, operates under 5 different commands, which are: "espresso", "latte", "cappuccino", "off" and "report".
Currency is set to nickels, dimes, quarters and pennies.

Last content seen on that course was dictionaries, dont expect perfect code, as I'm learning step by step. 
Nevertheless, a lot of effort was made in order to have a relatively "clean" code. (I gave multiple nicks to the machine in the process, it gave me headaches in exchange)
